ECG signals are widely used in clinical practice for detecting arrhythmias, monitoring cardiac function, and guiding diagnosis and treatment. Automated analysis of ECG signals is therefore an important application area for deep learning, with direct implications for screening, triage, and decision support.\n","\n","In this question, you will work with a cleaned ECG dataset. The dataset contains **197 records** drawn from **three arrhythmia databases**. All signals have been resampled to **128 Hz**, and each recording is approximately **30 minutes** in duration. Each record is stored as a Python dictionary with the following fields:\n","\n","- `patient_id`: an anonymised identifier for the patient from whom the recording was obtained.  \n","- `source_db`: the originating database for this record.  \n","- `sampling_rate`: the sampling frequency of the signal in Hz (128 for this cleaned dataset).  \n","- `signal`: a one-dimensional array containing the ECG time series.  \n","- `beat_locs`: an array of sample indices marking the onset of each annotated heartbeat in the signal.  \n","- `beat_labels`: an array of integer labels associated with each beat location.\n","\n","Beat labels in this assessment have been mapped to a simplified index space from **0** to **4**, where **0** denotes normal beats, **1** and **2** correspond to different abnormality subclasses (supra ventricular ectopic (SVEB) and ventricular ectopic beats (VEB)), and **3** represents unknown or other beats. The exact mapping between indices and the original clinical annotation classes is provided in the accompanying file `class_mapping.json`. You should refer to this file when interpreting the label distribution and when designing your models.\n","\n","This question is divided into three parts:\n","\n","- **Part 2.A – Exploratory Data Analysis and Tooling**: you will perform basic exploration of the ECG signals and annotations, and construct simple plotting and preprocessing utilities to support the later tasks.  \n","- **Part 2.B – Classification and Anomaly Detection**: you will build a supervised deep learning model for beat-level classification, using the simplified label scheme, and explicitly examine its behaviour for normal versus abnormal beats.  \n","- **Part 2.C – Discussion**: you will critically discuss your modelling choices, results, limitations, and potential improvements, in a concise written analysis guided by the prompts.\n","\n","You should approach these parts progressively: insights and tools developed in Part 2.A are expected to inform and support your solutions in Parts 2.B and 2.C.\n","\n","<br>\n","\n","---\n","\n","<br>\n","\n","The next few blocks of code provided in the notebook will download the dataset, load the ECG records into memory, and import the accompanying class–mapping file required for interpreting the beat labels."]},{"cell_type":"code","execution_count":null,"id":"d4963c1d","metadata":{"id":"d4963c1d"},"outputs":[],"source":["# Use this snippet to download the dataset\n","dataset = load_dataset(\"dpelacani/ecg-led2-cleaned\")\n","\n","# download class_mapping.json\n","mapping_path = hf_hub_download(\n","    repo_id=\"dpelacani/ecg-led2-cleaned\",\n","    filename=\"class_mapping.json\",\n","    repo_type=\"dataset\"\n",")\n","\n","# load it\n","with open(mapping_path, \"r\") as f:\n","    idx_to_class = json.load(f)\n","\n","print(dataset, idx_to_class)  # print dataset and mapping"]},{"cell_type":"markdown","id":"7f672f61","metadata":{"id":"7f672f61"},"source":["<br><br>\n","\n","## 2.A) Exploratory Data Analysis and Pre-processing\n","\n","The goal of this part is to carry out a set of simple exploratory checks on the ECG dataset and to prepare the beat-level representation that will be used in later tasks.

You must also decide on **suitable evaluation metrics** for this problem.\n","\n","- As established in Part 2.A, the dataset is **heavily imbalanced**, with normal beats dominating the distribution. This affects both training and evaluation: models that ignore imbalance tend to overfit normal beats while failing on minority abnormal classes. **Strong solutions will address imbalance explicitly and will aim to produce models that perform reliably across all classes, not only the majority one.** You are, therefore, required to report each validation metric twice: one for normal (0) and one for abnormal (1-2), separately.\n","\n","- Only include code that is necessary to reproduce your results.
